# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Equipment
This is a course project for machine learning (ELL409) course. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting equipment failures using sensor data from industrial equipment. Employing the NASA C-MAPSS dataset of turbofan engines, the study explores advanced methods such as feature engineering, noise removal and utilizing deep learning techniques like LSTM networks for sequence prediction. This research underscores the effectiveness of predictive maintenance in optimizing industrial operations while addressing challenges such as feature selection and model interpretability. The proposed model’s outcomes will be evaluated using performance metrics such as root mean square error, mean absolute error and s-score.
